        writer (or an LLM) could follow to produce output that genuinely sounds like that person.

        DO NOT produce vague descriptors like "conversational" or "engaging". These are useless \
        to a writer. Be specific about:

        1. VOICE: Does the author write in first person? Do they address the reader directly? \
           Do they use "we" or "you"? Are they opinionated or neutral?
        2. OPENING PATTERN: How do posts start? Problem statement? Anecdote? Provocative claim? \
           Direct dive into content?
        3. HUMOUR & PERSONALITY: Where and how does humour appear? Is it dry? Self-deprecating? \
           Analogy-based? What kinds of references do they reach for?
        4. TECHNICAL DEPTH: Do they explain concepts from scratch or assume baseline knowledge? \
           Do they show code? At what level of detail?
        5. STRUCTURE: Do they use headers? How often? Do they prefer lists or prose? \
           How do paragraphs end — with a conclusion, a question, or a pivot to the next idea?
        6. WHAT TO AVOID: What patterns are absent from this author's writing that a generic \
           AI would reach for? (e.g. "never ends with 'In conclusion'", \
           "never uses bullet points to summarise what the prose already said", \
           "never uses corporate hedging language like 'it's worth noting that'")
